# gMetapop
A flexible forward simulation program for modelling the evolution of genes and phenotypes in subdivided populations of species with complex demographic features.

## Overview ##
gMetapop is an individual-based program. Individuals are characterized by their genotype at many loci and/or by their phenotype at a given trait coded by  QTL. 

Different types of genes (neutral or under selection) can be simulated, in populations connected by gene flow via zygote migration (e.g. seed flow) or male gamete migration (e.g. pollen flow). Demographic models with overlapping generations are easily simulated (e.g. perennial species such as trees with an age class structure), complex mating systems including selfing and clonal reproduction also. Selection can be applied within and among populations, either on a phenotypic trait or directly by assigning fitness values to each genotype. The total number of loci, individuals, populations and/or reproductive events is only limited by the users’ hardware capacities. 

One main advantage of this tool is its flexible Graphical User Interface (GUI) available under Windows and Linux OS. The GUI aims at replacing the cumbersome process of building the large configuration parameter files needed for elaborate evolutionary scenarios. The users can therefore focus on their biological model. The GUI makes also the program a great learning/teaching tool for basic evolutionary processes.

Two main components constitute the program:  

•	gMetapop_GUI, the interface program which guides the user for designing simulations, launching them, and getting results graphical overview. Technically, the GUI creates a .xml parameter configuration file (param hereafter) with all initial settings and files needed for a simulation run.

•	gMetapop_CORE, the program that takes these files as input to perform the simulations. gMetapop_CORE can be launched directly from the GUI or using command lines under Linux or Windows DOS command prompt. gMetapop_CORE initially stemmed from previous programs that included separate and complementary features (Le Corre et al., 1997; Austerlitz et al. 2000; Machon et al., 2003; Austerlitz & Garnier-Géré 2003; Le Corre and Kremer, 2003). However in this first release, 88% of the whole program code is new (70%) or has been largely modified or extended (18%). 

## Help ##
Various sources of Help are available 

•	Default parameter values proposed in the GUI and automatically loaded in the GUI when making a new param file. We chose them so that they were plausible in scenarios corresponding to non-extreme biological conditions. Therefore, users can keep those values as starting points for preliminary tests that focus on particular parameters, provided that they carefully checked if those are compatible with the organisms that they have in mind.

•	Tooltips appear on screen that describe tabs and parameters within the GUI, when moving the “mouse” on the each sub-window/group-box part of the GUI in a Tab. Tooltips are small texts providing definitions and main use of the corresponding GUI options, for a rapid and intuitive appraisal of particular aspects of the modelled processes (see more explanations in Chapter 3 User Manual for each GUI option). 

•	Tutorials to reproduce simulation tests 1 to 13 are given in Chapter 5 of the User Manual <A HREF="https://github.com/gMetapop/gMetapop/tree/master/User-Manual"> here</A>. Corresponding param configuration files for each test for loading into the GUI, with configuration files for launching simulations, and results files / post-treatment examples are provided <A HREF="https://github.com/gMetapop/gMetapop/tree/master/Simulation..Examples"> here</A>. Some of these param files might be better starting points than default parameters in some cases.

•	Finally, more explanations can be found in the User Manual on different GUI features and processes modelled in gMetapop_CORE (Chapter 3), on all input and output files (Chapter 4), and on detailed step by step procedure for building param configuration files (Chapter 5).
